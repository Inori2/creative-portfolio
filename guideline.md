# Coding & Formatting Guideline

## General Guidelines

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs as they can cause inconsistencies across different editors and IDEs.
2. **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters. Longer lines can be hard to read, especially in terminals or narrow screens.
3. **Whitespace**: Maintain proper whitespace around operators and after commas to improve readability.
4. **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, etc. Use camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes and methods.
5. **Comments**: Write clear comments that describe what the code is intended to do. Avoid writing obvious comments (e.g., `// Increment counter`).
6. **Consistency**: Be consistent with your coding style throughout the project, including spacing around operators, use of parentheses for control structures, etc.

## Code Block Formatting

1. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (\```) to format code blocks. For example:
